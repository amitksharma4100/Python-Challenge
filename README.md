# Python-Challenge
This challenge required completion of two python programs, one for summarizing several profit/losses attributes for a firm over an 86 month period.  And second one for summarizing election results outcome.  
As per instructions, there are two folders namely Pybank and Pypoll included in this submission.  Please note that when the name "main.py" was used, the computer automatically added .py to the name.  Therefore the executable file name is main.py.py
